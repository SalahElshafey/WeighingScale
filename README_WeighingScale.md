# WeighingScale â€“ IoT Weight Monitoring System

An IoT-enabled smart weighing system built using **ESP8266**, **HX711 load cell**, and **MQTT protocol**, with real-time data visualization via a **Flask web app**.  

The system is designed to measure weight, process the data on the ESP8266 microcontroller, and publish readings to an MQTT broker. A Python Flask server subscribes to the broker, streams live updates to the web interface, and enables seamless monitoring from anywhere.

## Overview

The **WeighingScale** project addresses the need for remote and automated weight monitoring across industries such as **logistics, healthcare, and agriculture**.  

By leveraging **ESP8266 Wi-Fi connectivity**, **HX711 weight sensing**, and **MQTT lightweight messaging**, the system achieves reliable, low-cost, and scalable real-time weight monitoring.

---

## Features

- **Real-time weight monitoring** with averaged sensor readings (10 samples for accuracy).  
- **Wi-Fi connectivity** with automatic reconnection for robustness.  
- **MQTT-based communication** using the `weight_monitoring` topic.  
- **Flask web interface** for live visualization of weight data.  
- **Debugging support** via Serial Monitor for ESP8266.  
- **Lightweight and scalable** IoT design with low hardware cost.  

---

## System Architecture

1. **ESP8266** connects to Wi-Fi, reads weight from HX711, and publishes readings to **HiveMQ public MQTT broker**.  
2. **MQTT broker** manages topic-based message exchange (`weight_monitoring`).  
3. **Flask web server** subscribes to MQTT and streams weight updates to a live web dashboard.  

---

## Hardware Components

- **ESP8266 microcontroller** â€“ Wi-Fi-enabled IoT controller.  
- **HX711 load cell amplifier** â€“ Converts load cell analog signals to digital.  
- **Load Cell** â€“ Measures applied weight.  
- **USB power supply** â€“ Powers the ESP8266.  

**Pin configuration:**  
- HX711 `DT â†’ D5`  
- HX711 `SCK â†’ D6`  

---

## Software Components

### Arduino (ESP8266 firmware)
- **Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE)  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `ESP8266WiFi.h` â€“ Wi-Fi connectivity  
  - `PubSubClient.h` â€“ MQTT communication  
  - `HX711.h` â€“ Load cell data acquisition  

### Python Backend (Flask app)
Located in `script.py`:
- Subscribes to MQTT broker (`broker.hivemq.com`, port 1883).  
- Streams messages to Flask app via Server-Sent Events (SSE).  
- Serves a simple web dashboard (`index.html`) with real-time updates.

## Installation

### ESP8266 Setup
1. Open `first_try.ino` in Arduino IDE.  
2. Install required libraries:
   - ESP8266WiFi
   - PubSubClient
   - HX711  
3. Update Wi-Fi SSID & password in the code.  
4. Upload code to ESP8266.

### Flask Server Setup
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SalahElshafey/WeighingScale.git
cd WeighingScale

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install flask paho-mqtt
```

Run the server:
```bash
python script.py
```
Access the dashboard at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
